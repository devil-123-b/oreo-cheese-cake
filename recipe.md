Instructions
Before I start all the ingredients were at room temperature.

Wrap the outer surface of a 7” loose-bottomed cake pan with aluminium foil, this wrapping will prevent leaking of the mixture at the time of baking.

For the base grind oreo cookies and butter in a food processor until a coarse mixture forms. Spread this mixture evenly on the base of the springform/loose-bottomed cake tin. Keep the cake tin in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. Start making the cheesecake filling in-between.

Preheat the oven to 150 degrees C. In a bowl add cream cheese. Start whisking with an electronic hand mixer until smooth. Don’t whisk the cream cheese for a longer time, just make it a bit smooth first so that we can mix in the other ingredients easily. 

Now add condensed milk, vanilla extract, and yogurt (read note). Whisk well, transfer this cheese mixture into the cake pan. Smooth out the top with a spatula. 

Prepare a larger pan (read note) with hot water and place the cake pan carefully onto it. The water level should be halfway up to the cake pan.

Bake for 90 minutes or until the top of the cheesecake turns golden brown and the edges shrink a bit from the sides of the cake pan (read note). At the time of baking, the cake will rise to some extent, and it will come down to a flat top later, which is normal.

Switch off the oven, and leave the cake pan inside for 1 hour with the oven door slightly opened.

Take out the cake pan from the water bath, don’t unwrap the foil from the outside of the pan now. 

Transfer the cake tin onto a cooling rack, and let it be cooled completely at room temperature.

Shift in the fridge for a minimum of 4 hours or you can chill it overnight. Unmould before serving (read note).

Slice and serve cold, enjoy!
